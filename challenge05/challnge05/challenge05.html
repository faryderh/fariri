        <p>The <em>San Francisco garter snake</em> Some people consider the San Francisco garter snake
           to be the most beautiful species in the world. That is, of course, subjective, but it's a
           stunningly beautiful snake. Known for the bright turquoise stripes that run alongside deep
           coral and black, the snake is a sight to behold.
           Unfortunately, it's also an exceedingly rare sight. This snake is on the Endangered Species list,
           with perhaps as few as 1,000-2,000 adults remaining on Earth. It's difficult to do the snake's
           coloration justice in a photo.</p>
