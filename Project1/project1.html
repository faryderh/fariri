    <h1 class="fari">Top 5 Things to See and Do in the Maldives</h1>
  <ol>
  <p>The Maldives are the perfect place for honeymoons and couples looking for a luxury island vacation.
     This country of 1,000 islands has everything a person could want in a tropical island: clear water,
     white sand beaches, palm trees, warm sunny days, and lots of great diving. It’s as close to heaven
     as you can get. While the Maldives have always been thought of as an expensive, honeymoon /couple
     place to visit, it’s actually an incredible budget traveler destination. Yeah, the resorts are
     expensive (even the ones on the cheaper end) but the country has opened up its tourism in recent
     years and now allows locals to start their own guesthouses and the ferry system is greatly improving.
     You can easily visit these countries on a budget and still get to experience that picture perfect
     beach vacation you came here for!</p>

     <li><h2 class="key">Explore Male</h2>
     <p>This relatively small city is host to many interesting mosques, museums.
     The Hukuru Miskiiy, also known as the Old Friday Mosque, is the oldest in
     the country, dating back to 1656. Some other interesting places to check out
     are the National Art Gallery, the National Stadium, and Sultan’s Park.</p></li>

    <li><h2 class="key">Dive in the Banana Reef</h2>
     <p>This is a protected marine area that is known internationally for its beauty
     and incredible diving and snorkeling. The numerous caves, overhangs, and dramatic
     cliff lines result in stunning photos with every shot you snap. The brilliant
     coral growth attracts a huge range of sea life, including grouper, barracuda,
     morays, jackfish, snapper, and more.</p></li>

     <li><h2 class="key">Visit the Mahibadhoo</h2>
     <p>Mahibadhoo is clean (locals volunteer to clean the island once a week),
     and the buildings were more colorful, featuring a rainbow of pastel-colored
     structures. Though it doesn’t have a “bikini beach” (as the beaches for foreigners
     are called), there is good snorkeling right off shore, and it’s a launching pad for
     day trips to deserted atolls and quieter islands like Dhanbidhoo, Kalhaidhoo, and Isdhoo.</p></li>

    <li><h2 class="key">Try some dishes</h2>
     <p>The food here is beyond delicious and incredibly fresh. Most of the restaurants
      in Male offer outdoor dining areas. Some of the more popular places to go include
      The Seagull Café, Symphony, Royal Garden Café, and Irudhashu Hotaa (for quick meals).
      A prevalent food in Maldives, Mas Huni - shredded smoked Tuna, served with grated coconuts,
      lemon and onions is a must try. The dish is undoubtedly the most popular Maldivian breakfast,
      eaten with chapati bread called Roshi.</p></li>

      <li><h2 class="key">Do some watersports</h2>
      <p>Check out one of the many water sports available throughout the Maldives.
      The water here is great for a ride, whether it’s via a banana boat, parasailing,
      water skiing, or any other number of things. You are sure to have a thrilling time!
      Talking about water sports in Maldives and not mentioning flyboarding is impossible.
      If you are someone who is gutsy to try something that not everyone else is doing and
      that does involve risk (TBH), then flyboarding is for you. It is an extreme sport and
      was invented only recently. Flyboarding involves getting on a flyboard which is attached
      to a jet ski by a hose and sends it up in the air, which is why it is one of the most
      popular water activities in Maldives.</p></li>
